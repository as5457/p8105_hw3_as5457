Problem 1
=========

**Load the BRFSS data**

First, do some data cleaning:

-   Format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   Focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   Organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
#Loading the dataset from the p8105.datasets package
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

#Defining a new dataset called brfss_smart from the original dataset
brfss_smart = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  
#Cleaning variable names
janitor::clean_names(dat = .) %>% 
  
#Keeping only rows where the topic was "Overall Health"
  filter(topic == "Overall Health")
  
#Organizing responses as a factor taking levels from "Excellent" to "Poor"

brfss_smart$response = as.factor(brfss_smart$response)
class(brfss_smart$response)
```

    ## [1] "factor"

``` r
brfss_smart %>%
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_reorder(response, display_order))
```

    ## # A tibble: 10,625 x 23
    ##     year locationabbr locationdesc class topic question response
    ##    <int> <chr>        <chr>        <chr> <chr> <chr>    <fct>

    ## [1] "factor"

**Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the results of each):**

-   In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

The states that were observed at 7 locations were CT, FL, NC.

``` r
brfss_smart %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ") %>% 
  distinct(state, county) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter (n == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   state     n
    ##   <chr> <int>
    ## 1 CT        7
    ## 2 FL        7
    ## 3 NC        7

-   Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
spaghetti = brfss_smart %>% 
  group_by (year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize (n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs (
    title = "Number of Observations in Each State by Year",
        x = "year",
        y = "number of observations"
  )
spaghetti
```

-   Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
year02 = brfss_smart %>% 
  filter (year == 2002)
year06 = brfss_smart %>%
  filter (year == 2006)
year10 = brfss_smart %>% 
  filter (year == 2010)
filteredyear = bind_rows(year02, year06, year10)

filteredyear %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_prop = mean(data_value),
            std_prop = sd(data_value))
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##    year mean_prop std_prop
    ##   <int>     <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1  2002      24.0     4.49
    ## 2  2006      22.5     4.00
    ## 3  2010      22.7     3.57

-   For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

First converting year into a factor variable

``` r
brfss_smart$year=as.factor(brfss_smart$year)
```

``` r
brfss_smart %>% 
  group_by (response, locationabbr, year) %>% 
  summarize(avg_prop = mean (data_value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_prop)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ response) +
  labs (
    title = "Distribution of state-level averages over time",
        x = "year",
        y = "average proportion"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 21 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).
